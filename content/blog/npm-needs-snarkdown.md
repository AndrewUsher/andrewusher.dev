## What Is It?

`snarkdown` is a barebones markdown parser with the sole purpose of converting markdown to HTML. This could be used in cases where you don't need a full fledged tool like [`marked`](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) or [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)

## Usage Examples

```js
import snarkdown from 'snarkdown'
console.log(snarkdown('# Hello World'))
// '<h1>Hello World</h1>'
```
