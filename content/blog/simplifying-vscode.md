## Introduction
As a long-time user of Visual Studio Code (VSCode), I've accumulated a vast array of extensions, settings, and files that have made my workspace cluttered and overwhelming. I found myself spending more time searching for files and navigating through menus than actually coding. It was time for a change.

In this blog post, I'll share my experience of cleaning up and simplifying my VSCode workspace. I'll discuss the steps I took to remove unused extensions, organize my files, customize settings, and use keyboard shortcuts and snippets to streamline my workflow. By the end of this post, you'll have a better understanding of how to optimize your workspace and improve your coding experience. So, let's dive in!

## Extensions I Removed 

- [codecrumbs-vs-code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codecrumbs.codecrumbs-vs-code) - Never used it after the first few weeks of installing
- [Codetour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) - Same as above
- [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost) - I use Bundlephobia for this instead
- [Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright) - I use [Playwright's UI mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode) for this functionality now
- [Polacode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode) - I use [ray.so](https://ray.so/) instead now
- [ReacTree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ReacTreeDev.reactree) - Seemed cool when I looked at it, but I've never had a use case for it
- [Remove Non ASCII Chars](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SamuelCharpentier.remove-non-ascii-chars) - The linting tools I use already handles this

## Status Bar Sections Removed
- Workspace Trust
- GitLens Commit Graph
- Problems
- Editor Selection
- Editor Indentation
- Editor Encoding
- Editor End of Line
- Editor Language Status
- Editor Language
- Prettier
- Feedback
- Notifications

## Sidebar Icons Removed
After years of use, the sidebar in VSCode can become cluttered with icons, making it difficult to navigate and find what you need. To simplify my workspace, I recently removed the below sidebar icons:

- Run and Debug
- Extensions
- GitLab Workflow
- GitLens
- TODOs
- Bookmarks
- Accounts

## Conclusion

In conclusion, by removing unused extensions, status bar sections, and sidebar icons, as well as organizing files, customizing settings, and using keyboard shortcuts and snippets, I was able to simplify my VSCode workspace and improve my coding experience. It's important to regularly review and optimize your workspace to ensure that it remains efficient and clutter-free.
