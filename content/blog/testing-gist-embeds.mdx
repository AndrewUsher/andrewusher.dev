import Gist from '../../src/components/Gist.astro';

This is a test post to demonstrate GitHub Gist embedding capabilities in our Astro blog.

## Basic Gist Embed

Here's a simple example of embedding a complete gist. This Advent of Code solution shows multiple JavaScript files:

<Gist id="cc23628a71c0cb1a9194161a8f9ea3f7" />

## Embedding a Specific File

When a gist contains multiple files, you can embed just one specific file:

<Gist id="cc23628a71c0cb1a9194161a8f9ea3f7" file="Box.js" />

## Line Highlighting

You can also highlight specific lines to draw attention to important parts of the code:

<Gist id="cc23628a71c0cb1a9194161a8f9ea3f7" file="q1.js" lines="1-5" />

This highlights lines 1 through 5 to emphasize the important parts.

## Dark Mode Support

The gist embeds automatically adapt to your site's dark mode. Try toggling dark mode to see the theme switch!

## Why Gist Embeds?

Embedding gists offers several advantages:

1. **Always up-to-date**: When you update the gist on GitHub, the embedded version updates automatically (on rebuild)
2. **Syntax highlighting**: Built-in syntax highlighting for dozens of languages
3. **Version control**: Full Git history for your code snippets
4. **Easy sharing**: Same gist can be embedded across multiple blog posts or sites

## Technical Implementation

The gist embedding is implemented using:
- Astro components for server-side rendering
- GitHub API for fetching gist content at build time
- Shiki for syntax highlighting with both light and dark themes
- Tailwind CSS for responsive, accessible styling
