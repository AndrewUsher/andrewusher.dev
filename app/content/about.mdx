## About Me

I'm a dedicated and dependable front-end web developer and designer that specializes in landing pages and personal portfolios. My goal is to use the Internet to reach out to others and assist them in establishing an online presence. I like to build things - usually with technology, and I believe technology should enhance every person's life.

Throughout my life, I've had a passion for computers. As a teenager, I toyed around in programs like Adobe Illustrator and got pretty good at it. Now, I'm super passionate about web design and development, and I have one year of study behind me.

I also enjoy cycling around the city and exploring, and have been riding bikes for over 10 years and have completed trips ranging from 20 to 40 miles. I'm inspired by a cup of hot chocolate, good music, and interesting documentaries.
